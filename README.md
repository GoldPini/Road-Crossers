# Road-Crossers
Welcome to Road-Crossers, my prototype game! In this simple but challenging little game, your objective is to cross the road, dodge oncoming traffic, beat the clock, and handle a few unexpected twists along the way. The concept draws inspiration from the classic Frogger game, for those who remember it :)

**Important note:**
- This is my first Unity project, and as such, it’s more of a prototype — a learning experiment built through trial and error. What you're seeing is the current result of that journey.

**Overview and Features:**
- The game was developed in the Unity game engine and C# as the programming language
- Utilization of Design patterns for scalable and maintainable game architecture
- Multiple difficulty levels: each level increases the number and speed of vehicles, with new challenges in later stages
- Dynamic sound system: responsive vehicle, player, and ambient sound effects
- Procedurally generated levels: roads are Precederally generated with configurable length and difficulty
- Custom made UI

 Feedback will be highly appreciated:)

 Enjoy!
